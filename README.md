- prepare data (standard gender and region, remove dollar, drop negative, convert negative to 0 in children, drop values if 5 below 5%
- EDA
- create and evaluate model of regression model
- apply model regression to estimate predict charges for unseen data in validation_dataset.csv
- store prediction as new column in validation dataset, predicting charges
- handle with negative values replacing them with minimum basic charges set at 1000.
